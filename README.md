# TH_GTCyberFinalProject
An Offensive Penetration Test / Defensive Operations Report / Network Operations Report of a WordPress Site
Lab Environment: Azure
 
Project Overview:
 
●  	Implement alerts in Kibana.
●  	Assess additional vulnerable VMs to test these alerts.
●  	Analyze live traffic on the network using Wireshark  to determine user activity.

This final project was assigned to challenge my ability to assess vulnerable Virtual Machines (VMs) and analyze network data in Kibana from a defensive security perspective. However, the vulnerable machines on this network expose vulnerable web servers rather than vulnerable network services. Kibana was used to not only analyze logs, but also set and test alerts.
The documents labeled “red team” in this folder demonstrate how to exploit a vulnerable WordPress installation. Then provide a summary report and presentation to the client as if I had conducted a real-world penetration testing. The implementation of Kibana alerts and a dashboard demonstrate my ability to create, monitor and understand real-time network monitoring from a security operations center (SOC) perspective.  In addition, the “blue team” reports in this folder demonstrate the ability to assess, understand and provide recommendations for improvement of an existing company network asset from a defensive perspective.  Lastly, the documents labeled “network analysis” demonstrate the capability to utilize Wireshark to capture and analyze live traffic on the virtual network.
